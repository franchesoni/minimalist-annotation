## üåê Project Overview

This tool allows users to annotate images by adding positive/negative points or drawing bounding boxes. It features functionality for managing and saving annotations in JSON format, panning, zooming, and other customizable options. It is highly adaptable to various annotation workflows and comes with a range of features to improve the user experience.

### üîß Features

#### Visualization

- **Pan**: Drag with left click.
- **Zoom**: Scroll mouse wheel.
- **Reset View**: Click the "Reset View" button.
- **Next Image**: Click `Next` or press `RightArrow`.
- **Previous Image**: Click `Previous` or press `LeftArrow`.

#### Annotation

- **Switch Mode**: Switch between point annotation and bounding box annotation modes.
- **Box Annotation**: Use two left clicks per bounding box.
- **Point Annotation**: Use left click for positive points and right click for negative points.
- **Text Annotation**: Each image has its own text box for descriptions.
- **Delete Annotation**: Click `Undo` or use `CTRL+Z` to remove the last annotation, or click `Clear` to remove all annotations on the current image.
- **Save/Load**: Save your annotations to a file or load previous annotations using the `Save` and `Load` buttons.

#### QOL (Quality of Life)
- Each annotation also includes a **delete button** for easy removal and a **hide button** for better visualisation when there is an important amount of annotations.
- **Select Annotation from Canva**: Wheel Click on a point or a bounding box put the selected annotation in **focus**.
#### Privacy & Security

This tool is entirely **browser-based** with **no data sent to any server**. Your images and annotations remain local, ensuring complete privacy. You can run the tool offline, and you are welcome to inspect the source code if you'd like to verify its behavior.

:warning: Only trust the `.html` file if it comes from this repository or you have checked the source code, as it is easy to create a very similar app that steals your data.

1. **Download** the HTML file from the repository.
2. **Open** the file in your browser (no server required).
