# üìç Single File Image Annotation Tool

**We created something easy to install and use... [give it a try!](https://franchesoni.github.io/single_file_annotation_tool/)**

Please ‚≠ê if you find it useful.

## About
A simple yet powerful interface for annotating images by adding points and bounding boxes. This tool is useful for annotating bounding boxes and points for tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation. It is a single `.html` file, that you can open in your browser. It ensures complete privacy, as all data stays local on your device.

You might want to download `smalldino.onnx` and place it in the same folder than `src/index.html' in order to leverage feature extraction capabilities.

## üåê Project Overview

This tool allows users to annotate images by adding positive/negative points or drawing bounding boxes. It features functionality for managing and saving annotations in JSON format, panning, zooming, and other customizable options. It is highly adaptable to various annotation workflows and comes with a range of features to improve the user experience.

### üîß Features

#### Visualization

- **Pan**: Drag with left click.
- **Zoom**: Scroll mouse wheel.
- **Reset View**: Click the "Reset View" button.
- **Next Image**: Click `Next` or press `RightArrow`.
- **Previous Image**: Click `Previous` or press `LeftArrow`.

#### Annotation

- **Switch Mode**: Switch between point annotation and bounding box annotation modes.
- **Box Annotation**: Use two left clicks per bounding box.
- **Point Annotation**: Use left click for positive points and right click for negative points.
- **Text Annotation**: Each image has its own text box for descriptions.
- **Delete Annotation**: Click `Undo` or use `CTRL+Z` to remove the last annotation, or click `Clear` to remove all annotations on the current image.
- **Save/Load**: Save your annotations to a file or load previous annotations using the `Save` and `Load` buttons.

#### QOL (Quality of Life)
- Each annotation also includes a **delete button** for easy removal and a **hide button** for better visualisation when there is an important amount of annotations.
- **Select Annotation from Canva**: Wheel Click on a point or a bounding box put the selected annotation in **focus**.
#### Privacy & Security

This tool is entirely **browser-based** with **no data sent to any server**. Your images and annotations remain local, ensuring complete privacy. You can run the tool offline, and you are welcome to inspect the source code if you'd like to verify its behavior.

:warning: Only trust the `.html` file if it comes from this repository or you have checked the source code, as it is easy to create a very similar app that steals your data.

## üíª Installation

To use this tool, follow these simple steps:

1. **Download** the HTML file from the repository.
2. **Open** the file in your browser (no server required).
3. Begin annotating your images!

> This tool is fully offline and self-contained‚Äîno installation or external dependencies are required.

## üåê Use Cases

This tool is versatile and adaptable to a range of image annotation use cases, including object detection and semantic segmentation. There is a folder in the repo with an OCR annotation version contributed by [Frederic Huang](https://github.com/Huang-Frederic) in the repository.

- approve pull request from Frederic Huang 
## Initial commits
- add help
- add load annotations button
- add textbox
- implement bounding box code
- add undo button
- create annotation tool for clicks
    - allows for downloads
    - positive / negative clicks
    - panning

# Roadmap
- allow to load bbox predictions
- allow to load masks (imgname_mask_pred.png)
- allow to validate masks
- add transparency slider for mask visualization
- allow to flag masks as correct

# done
- fix: go next and back, the mask disappears, need to press run again, the mask is not shown
- fix: find out why the mask on different images is not what it should be <- black and white images don't work for rgb mode (cosine distance) 
- fix USE_RGB switch <- haven't tried dino
- fix clicking on an image, going to another and clicking (should raise)
- try dino
- hitl dino, sync webworker with annotation tool (single image)
    - there are three cases for annotation addition / removal: before starting computing the feature map (should never happen, as feature map computation should start as soon as the image is loaded or before), during the computation, or after it. For after the computation, we have the code. We need to add the code for during the computation. Basically when a computation is done, we should look at the annotations and create the vectors accordingly (function "updateVectors"). Then whenever an annotation is added / removed we rerun the "updateVectors". This function should look at the annotations included so far, remove any extra, and see if we can include some that were not included given the feature maps available. Whenever a feature map is computed or annotations are modified we updateVectors. Then we have feature map computation which has a queue and can be stopped if the queue is modified, but this is more complex and comes later. 
    - in short, create updateVectors function that will run whenever annotations are updated or whenever a feature map is computed
    <- seems to work for a single image 
- avoid reloading of model <- model is now cached by js into an indexed db so it's not realoaded at every call (that's what the worker was doing). Now we have the possibility to get a new worker which will be doing the processing, destroy it and create new ones to our liking. the onnx session already does parallel execution in the background so creating more workers is not really going to speed things up (most likely the contrary). So what I will do is to have a single worker that can be paused and restarted at will, and when restarted it will get the model from the indexeddb. but what if the webworker is stopped while downloading the first model? can I download the model on the main thread ? OK so what we will do is the following: 1. load the model (async) in the main thread into Uint8, 2. have a function to create a new worker, which also sends the model to it (and the webworker has a function to save the model), 3. then have a way to make the webworker compute features and 4, have a way to stop and restart the webworker if the current feature computation is useless. 
- hitl dino, sync webworker with annotation tool (many images) <- IN SHORT, we now load the model in the main thread, pass it to the worker when inited and kill the worker if it's working on the wrong image.
- hitl dino, automatic computation of features for each image <- done? 


# new roadmap
- hitl dino, model download
- hitl dino, visualization
- hitl dino, mask download
- hitl dino, prefetching
